Global UShER trees
=====================
UCSC provides downloadable tree and metadata files for daily-updated trees of genetic sequences for the following pathogens.


SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19)
---------------------
SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19. The global SARS-CoV-2 tree includes sequences from a variety of sources, including but not limited to INSDC (GenBank/ENA/DDBJ). `The SARS-CoV-2 trees and information about their data sources can be found here <https://hgdownload.gi.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/wuhCor1/UShER_SARS-CoV-2/>`_.

hMPXV (Mpox)
------------
Mpox, `previously known as monkeypox <https://www.who.int/news/item/28-11-2022-who-recommends-new-name-for-monkeypox-disease>`_, made news due to an outbreak in 2022. However, the disease is older than that, and the global MPXV tree includes INSDC samples from 2017 and later. The term "hMPXV" is used to reflect that these recent samples show sustained human-to-human transmission (clade IIb from the `Happi et al. nomenclature <https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001769>`_). The hMPXV trees can be found `here <https://hgdownload.gi.ucsc.edu/hubs/GCF/014/621/545/GCF_014621545.1/UShER_hMPXV/>`__.

RSV
---
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is divided into two antigenic types. Global trees developed using INDSDC samples for both RSV-A and RSV-B are available.

* `RSV-A <https://hgdownload.gi.ucsc.edu/hubs/GCF/002/815/475/GCF_002815475.1/UShER_RSV-A/>`_  
* `RSV-B <https://hgdownload.gi.ucsc.edu/hubs/GCF/000/855/545/GCF_000855545.1/UShER_RSV-B/>`_  

Dengue
------
The mosquito-borne dengue virus has four serotypes. UCSC maintains trees for each serotype based on INDSDC samples.

* DENV-1
* DENV-2
* DENV-3
* DENV-4

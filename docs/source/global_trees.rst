Global UShER trees
=====================

SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19)
---------------------
SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19. The global SARS-CoV-2 tree includes sequences from a variety of sources. `The SARS-CoV-2 trees and information about their data sources can be found here <https://hgdownload.gi.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/wuhCor1/UShER_SARS-CoV-2/>`_.

hMPXV (Mpox)
------------
Mpox, `previously known as monkeypox <https://www.who.int/news/item/28-11-2022-who-recommends-new-name-for-monkeypox-disease>`_, made news due to an outbreak in 2022. However, the disease is older than that, and the global MPXV tree includes INSDC hMPXV (human mpox virus) samples dating back to 2016. `The hMPXV trees can be found here <https://hgdownload.gi.ucsc.edu/hubs/GCF/014/621/545/GCF_014621545.1/UShER_hMPXV/>`_.
